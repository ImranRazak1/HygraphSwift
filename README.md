# # HygraphSwift

This is Collection Views an app made using UICollectionViews with UIKit. Multiple different layouts in a fake app store. The app connects through async URL session to the CMS which delegates the GraphQL with commands from the app and then return to the data to the app then decodes it and presents the information in a table view.

## Development notes

#### What went well?

    - URL Async session is very powerful and the performance of the app is quick.
    - Interfacing with GraphQL without additonal packages trial and error.

    

#### What could be better?

    - Making the connection view between Data Source a little eaiser compared to SwiftUI.
    - Remembering to include all three elments of a collection view ðŸ˜‚
    - Choose a CMS that can easily be decoded ðŸ˜‚
